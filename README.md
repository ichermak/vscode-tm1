# I want to contribute, how do I start?
Awesome, let's get you setup with the basic tools and documentation.  You can start by reading this project's [CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

This VS Code extension is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), which brings proper classes and strongly typed objects to the front-end space.  While traditional JavaScript will run perfectly fine in this environment, please try to make use of the benefits TypeScript brings as much as possible.

A few tools are needed to get up a running; primarly [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [VS Code Extension Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-code).  You can get both of these tools by running:
```
npm install -g yo generator-code
```

Clone the repo, enter into the `vscode-tm1` folder, open a PowerShell terminal (ensure the terminal session has a pwd inside the folder), and run:
```
npm install
```
This will install all of the node dependencies for the project.

Once everything is installed, you can edit the extension code going back to the root git folder (the one with the folder named `vscode-tm1` and running:
```
code ./vscode-tm1
```

For more information on how to get started, see the [VS Code Extension: Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension) guide.
